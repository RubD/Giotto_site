# Docker Image

We have set up a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/delron01/giotto) linked to RStudio with Giotto pre-installed. Follow these instructions to create your own Docker container and run Giotto:

1. ```docker pull delron01/giotto:latest```


2. ```docker run --rm -p 8787:8787 -e PASSWORD=mypassword delron01/giotto:latest```
    - You may use any port as long as it is not in use.
    - You can set the password to whatever you like.

3. Open the browser of your choice and enter ```localhost:yourport```.
    - Where ```yourport``` is either ```8787``` or the port you assigned it in step 2.

4. You will be directed to an RStudio login. 

    Username: rstudio
  
    Password: mypassword
    
    - The password you enter will be whatever you declared in step 2.
    
5. Run the following:
    ```{R} 
    library(Giotto)
    ```

Now you can run any analysis with Giotto!
