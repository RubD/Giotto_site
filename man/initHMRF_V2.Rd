Run initialzation for HMRF model

\details{
There are two steps to running HMRF. This is the first step, the initialization.
First, user specify which of Giotto's spatial genes to run, through use_spatial_genes.
Spatial genes have been stored in the gene metadata table. A first pass of genes will filter genes
that are not significantly spatial, as determined by filter_method. If filter_method is none,
then top 2500 (gene_sampling_from_top) genes ranked by pvalue are considered spatial.
If filter_method is elbow, then the exact cutoff is determined by the elbow in the
-log10Pvalue vs. gene rank plot.
Second, the filtered gene set is subject to sampling to select 500
(controlled by gene_samples) genes for running HMRF.
Third, once spatial genes are finalized, we are ready to initialize HMRF.
This consists of running a K-means algorithm to determine initial centroids (nstart, hmrf_seed) of HMRF.
The initialization is then finished.
This function returns a list containing y (expression), nei (neighborhood structure), numnei (number of neighbors), blocks (graph colors), damp (dampened factor), mu (mean), sigma (covariance), k, genes, edgelist. This information is needed for the second step, doHMRF.
