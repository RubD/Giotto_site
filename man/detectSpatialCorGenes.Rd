\description{
Detect genes that are spatially correlated
}
\details{
For method = network, it expects a fully connected spatial network. You can make sure to create a
fully connected network by setting minimal_k > 0 in the \code{\link{createSpatialNetwork}} function.
\itemize{
 \item{1. grid-averaging: }{average gene expression values within a predefined spatial grid}
 \item{2. network-averaging: }{smoothens the gene expression matrix by averaging the expression within one cell
 by using the neighbours within the predefined spatial network. b is a smoothening factor
 that defaults to 1 - 1/k, where k is the median number of  k-neighbors in the
 selected spatial network. Setting b = 0 means no smoothing and b = 1 means no contribution
 from its own expression.}

The spatCorObject can be further explored with showSpatialCorGenes()
