\description{
Function to calculate gene signature enrichment scores per spatial position using PAGE.
}
\details{
sign_matrix: a binary matrix with genes as row names and cell-types as column names.
Alternatively a list of signature genes can be provided to makeSignMatrixPAGE, which will create
the matrix for you. \cr

The enrichment Z score is calculated by using method (PAGE) from
Kim SY et al., BMC bioinformatics, 2005 as \eqn{Z = ((Sm â€“ mu)*m^(1/2)) / delta}.
For each gene in each spot, mu is the fold change values versus the mean expression
and delta is the standard deviation. Sm is the mean fold change value of a specific marker gene set
and  m is the size of a given marker gene set.
