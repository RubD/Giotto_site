\description{
Function to calculate gene signature enrichment scores per spatial position using a rank based approach.
}
\details{
sign_matrix: a rank-fold matrix with genes as row names and cell-types as column names.
Alternatively a scRNA-seq matrix and vector with clusters can be provided to makeSignMatrixRank, which will create
the matrix for you. \cr

First a new rank is calculated as R = (R1*R2)^(1/2), where R1 is the rank of
fold-change for each gene in each spot and R2 is the rank of each marker in each cell type.
The Rank-Biased Precision is then calculated as: RBP = (1 - 0.99) * (0.99)^(R - 1)
and the final enrichment score is then calculated as the sum of top 100 RBPs.
