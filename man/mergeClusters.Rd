\description{
Merge selected clusters based on pairwise correlation scores and size of cluster.
}
\details{
Merge selected clusters based on pairwise correlation scores and size of cluster.
To avoid large clusters to merge the max_group_size can be lowered. Small clusters can
be forcibly merged with their most similar pairwise cluster by adjusting the
force_min_group_size parameter. Clusters smaller than this value will be merged
independent on the provided min_cor_score value. The force_min_group_size might not always
be reached if clusters have already been merged before \cr
A giotto object is returned by default, if FALSE then the merging vector will be returned.
