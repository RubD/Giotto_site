\usage{
do_spatial_knn_smoothing(
  gobject,
  expression_values = c("normalized", "scaled", "custom"),
  subset_genes = NULL,
  spatial_network_name = "Delaunay_network",
  b = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gobject}{giotto object}

\item{expression_values}{gene expression values to use}

\item{subset_genes}{subset of genes to use}

\item{spatial_network_name}{name of spatial network to use}

\item{b}{smoothing factor beteen 0 and 1 (default: automatic)}
}
\value{
matrix with smoothened gene expression values based on kNN spatial network
}
\description{
smooth gene expression over a kNN spatial network
}
\details{
This function will smoothen the gene expression values per cell according to
its neighbors in the selected spatial network. \cr
b is a smoothening factor that defaults to 1 - 1/k, where k is the median number of
k-neighbors in the selected spatial network. Setting b = 0 means no smoothing and b = 1
means no contribution from its own expression.
